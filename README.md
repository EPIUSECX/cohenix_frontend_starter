# Doppio

A modern Frappe App to setup and manage single page applications and custom desk pages using Vue 3 or React on your custom Frappe App.

**✨ Now with Vue 3 Composition API, Pinia state management, and modern ES2020+ support!**

## Installation

In your bench directory:

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/NagariaHussain/doppio
```

This will install the `Doppio` frappe app on your bench and enable some custom bench CLI commands
that will ease the process of attaching a SPA to your Frappe Application.

## Setting Up React/Vue SPA

To set up a new Single Page Application, you can run the following command in your bench directory:

```bash
bench add-spa --app <app-name> [--tailwindcss] [--typescript] [--pinia]

# or just, and answer the prompts
bench add-spa
```

**Options:**
- `--tailwindcss`: Adds TailwindCSS styling framework
- `--typescript`: Uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- `--pinia`: (Vue only) Adds Pinia state management (recommended for larger apps)

You will be prompted to enter a name for your single page application, this will be the name of the directory and the URI path at which the application will be served. For instance, if you enter `dashboard` (default), then a folder named `dashboard` will be created inside your app's root directory and the application will be served at `/dashboard`.

You will then be asked to select the framework you prefer: React or Vue.

You can also select whether you want to use Typescript or Javascript.

You can optionally pass the `--tailwindcss` flag which will also setup tailwindCSS (who doesn't like tailwind!) along with the Vue 3/React application.

The above command will do the following things:

### For Vue 3

1. Scaffold a new Vue 3 starter application (using [Vite 5](https://vitejs.dev/))

2. Add and configure Vue Router 4 with modern patterns

3. **Uses Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax** for cleaner, more maintainable code

4. Link utility and controller files to make the connection with Frappe backend a breeze!

5. Configure Vite's proxy options (which will be helpful in development), check the `proxyOptions.js` file to see to what ports the Vite dev server proxies the requests (to your Frappe bench server).

6. Optionally, installs and sets up:
   - **TailwindCSS** for modern utility-first styling
   - **Pinia** state management (official Vue store, successor to Vuex)

7. Update the `website_route_rules` hook (in `hooks.py` of your app) to handle the routing of this SPA.

8. **Builds to ES2020 target** for optimal modern browser performance

### For React

1. Scaffold a new React 18+ starter application (using [Vite 5](https://vitejs.dev/))

2. Add and configure [frappe-react-sdk](https://github.com/nikkothari22/frappe-react-sdk) to make the connection with Frappe backend a breeze!

3. Configure Vite's proxy options (which will be helpful in development), check the `proxyOptions.js` file to see to what ports the Vite dev server proxies the requests (to your Frappe bench server).

4. Optionally, installs and sets up TailwindCSS for modern styling.

5. Update the `website_route_rules` hook (in `hooks.py` of your app) to handle the routing of this SPA.

6. **Builds to ES2020 target** for optimal modern browser performance

Once the setup is complete, you can `cd` into the SPA directory of your app (e.g. `dashboard`) and run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start a development server at port `8080` by default (any other port if this port's already in use). You can view the running application at: `<site>:8080`.

## Adding FrappeUI

If you want to add a [frappe-ui](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui) starter project to your custom app, you can do that using just a single command:

```bash
bench add-frappe-ui
```

## Creating Desk Pages

If you want to setup Vue 3 or React powered custom desk pages, you can do that with just a single command:

```bash
bench --site <site-name> add-desk-page --app <app-name>
```

Follow the prompt to select the framework of your choice and **everything will be setup for you auto-magically**! Once the setup is done, the page will be opened up in the browser.

> Note: Restart your bench to get auto-reload on file changes for your custom app

## Building for Production

The below command builds the application and places it in the `www` directory of your frappe app:

```bash
cd <your-spa-name> && yarn build
```

Check the `package.json` file inside the Vue application directory to learn more about the dev server / build steps.

If you already have a package.json file with scripts in your app's root directory, you can add the following two scripts to your app's package.json file in order for the `bench build` command to work as expected:

```json
"dev": "cd <your-spa-folder> && yarn dev",
"build": "cd <your-spa-folder> && yarn build"
```

## Example: Using Pinia Store (Vue)

If you generated your SPA with the `--pinia` flag, you can use state management like this:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useAppStore } from './stores/app';

const store = useAppStore();

// Access state
console.log(store.count);

// Call actions
store.increment();
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ store.count }}</p>
    <p>Double: {{ store.doubleCount }}</p>
    <button @click="store.increment()">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Python Packaging
